# Snake-LoginUI

This is a personal project of mine. It's for me to explore the SQLite3 library and Python's Tkinter to make a login system and UI.
The system will store passwords and usernames, as well as high scores earned in a little snake game made with the Turtle module that's built into Python. The project is almost finished. I just need to format how the leaderboards are dispalyed and work on menu navigation.
