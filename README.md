# Snake-LoginUI

This is a personal project of mine. It's basically me screwing around with SQLite3 and Python's Tkinter to make a login system and UI.
The system will store passwords and usernames, as well as high scores earned in a little snake game made with the Turtle module that's built into Python. I'm currently working on making the 2 files work together, so that I can display a leaderboard of high scores! To make the 2 files work together, I import the snake.py file on the press of a button and I am stuck on importing functions into snake.py from gui.py.
